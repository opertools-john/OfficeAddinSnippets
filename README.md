### Long and short of it:

#### Manifest
- ManifestElementOrdering displays the required order for manifest.xml elements
- BasicManifest has the basic structure of a manifest with a custom tab
- NewRibbonTab has instructions on how to add a new tab to the Word ribbon
- NewControlGroup has instructions on how to add a group to a ribbon tab
- NewMenuControl has instructions on how to add a new dropdown into a ribbon group
- NewButtonControl has instructions on how to add a new button into a ribbon group or menu control
- NewFunctionControl is a subset of a button control specifically geared toward adding a button control to run a JS/TS function

#### Snippets
- I'll add javascript code snippets here. Right now it's just one whole js file.

Feel free to submit issues with questions and comments.

#### Notes
- Use the Script Lab add-in for Word. It's a great tool for learning and snippets. You can also save gists straight from it. I'm not sure if it references the latest Word API requirement set, though.
- Make sure you're using the latest requirement set (1.6 as of now), NOT the Preview requirement set.
- Office Common API's are available as well, if they're helpful.
